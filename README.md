# hack-assembler
My nand2tetris hack assembler implementation.

This is based on the hack assembler specifications from the nand2tetris course.

The code is very messy as this is the first time of writing any
type of compiler or assembler. It seems to be 100% functional I didn't make really any
comments in the code.

### Usage
hasm \<assembler.asm\>

#### w_build
Is simply a backup of the working code before adding the symbol table.
