# hack-assembler
My nand2tetris hack assembler implementation.

The code is very messy as this is the first time of writing any
type of compiler or assembler. It seems to be 100% functional I didn't make really any
comments in the code.

### Usage
hasm \<assembler.asm\>

#### w_build
Is simply a backup of the working code before adding the symbol table.
